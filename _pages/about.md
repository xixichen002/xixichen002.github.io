Hi there! I’m Aurora Xi, a dedicated researcher deeply immersed in the study of eating disorders, perinatal mental health, and broader issues in women's mental health. I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in Psychology in 2023, where I focused my research on the perinatal mental health of ethnic minorities. After graduation, I completed a year of post-bac training at the Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Program, exploring the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying various eating disorders and learning diverse treatment approaches.

Recently, I have expanded my research to include societal and environmental factors related to ED symptoms and risks, such as bullying, teasing, and socioeconomic disadvantages. I am also a passionate advocate for designing and delivering low-cost, accessible interventions for ED prevention and treatment, and broadly, for improving women’s mental health across different life stages. Currently, I am engaged in designing research-oriented online brief interventions for body image disturbances and a public health-oriented AI-based app for binge eating self-help.

Outside the lab, I cherish the time spent with family and friends, enjoying outdoor activities and baking pastries to share. Let’s connect and make friends!
