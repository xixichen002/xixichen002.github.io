**Abstract**

*Background*

Understanding the emotional context of feeding behavior may help identify causal mechanisms of food avoidance among individuals with anorexia nervosa. Although predominant food avoidance models assume fear of fat drives feeding behavior, disgust may be more theoretically and proximally relevant to moment-to-moment experiences of feeding. This study, therefore, aimed to examine affect and food avoidance using automated affect analysis from facial response by measuring time-specific transitions in disgust during a laboratory eating paradigm. We hypothesized that phase transitions in disgust would distinguish temporally self-initiated eating from food avoidance.

*Methods*

Sixty-three adolescents with anorexia nervosa or another low-weight eating disorder (LWED) and 27 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited as part of a larger study; 45 patients and 22 controls provided data on autonomous eating and facial affect during a laboratory meal. Dynamic structural equation models quantified moment-to-moment relationships between disgust and feeding behavior.

*Results*

Self-initiated eating was associated with greater increases in disgust, but not fear, intensity among those with LWED relative to control participants and greater disgust intensity predicted lower likelihood of self-initiated eating.

*Discussion*

Phasic transitions in disgust provide moment-to-moment evidence of affective influence on self-initiated eating and lend credibility to the hypothesis that disgust contributes to food avoidance and initiation in individuals with LWED.
